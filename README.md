# team065-Project
For our final project, we used a dataset of flights from 2015, to create an interactive application where the user could keep track of their flight's status. The user can subscribe to a flight to keep track of if it was cancelled or not, or they can use a table of delayed flights to search for their flights delayed status. The most up to date work and info can be found in the Final Demo folder.
